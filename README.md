## 3. Transaction Workflow and Data Flow

### 3.1 Full Lifecycle (Intent-Based Execution)

#### Step 1: Intent Logging
1. User initiates transaction on Phoenix-integrated dApp (e.g., token swap).
2. SDK prompts user to confirm a human-readable intent.
3. Intent is hashed, signed, and stored in both:
   - On-chain Intent Registry (Avalanche/Cardano)
   - Off-chain IPFS (for auditability)

#### Step 2: Smart Contract Execution
4. User signs transaction with wallet.
5. dApp executes operation (swap, mint, transfer, stake).

#### Step 3: Transaction Validation
6. Transaction Verifier checks intent against executed transaction data:
   - Token types, amounts, recipient, slippage, timestamp.
7. If mismatch:
   - Trigger rollback logic (auto or manual).
   - Notify user and store discrepancy on-chain.

#### Step 4: Rollback & Dispute
- **If automatic rollback:**
   - Contract reverses transaction.
- **If dispute arises:**
   - Submit claim to Dispute DAO.
   - Evidence provided by both dApp and user.
   - DAO votes on fair outcome.

#### Step 5: Recovery and Governance
- Users can appoint guardians for social wallet recovery.
- If private key is lost:
   - Guardians verify identity.
   - Smart contract reassigns ownership.

## 5. Governance and Dispute Mechanism

### 5.1 Dispute Flow
1. Mismatch or malicious action detected
2. User submits dispute through dApp interface
3. Arbitration DAO collects evidence from both parties
4. AI + human jurors analyze:
   - Was user tricked?
   - Did smart contract behave maliciously?
5. Result:
   - Enforced rollback
   - Fund freeze
   - Dispute rejection (if invalid)

### 5.2 DAO Structure
- **Jury Pool**: Validators or reputation-holding users
- **AI Jury**: Verifies signatures, timestamps, market data
- **Outcome Execution**: Smart contract-triggered based on final vote

---

## 7. Security Design

- **Intent Signatures**: ECDSA with timestamped payload
- **Rollback Authenticity**: Only executable within 5-minute intent validity
- **Guardian Recovery**: M-of-N approval required from designated addresses
- **Dispute Logs**: Immutable trail stored on IPFS and chain
- **Slippage Protection**: Hardcoded thresholds in smart contracts
- **Front-End Protection**: SDK intercepts and validates UI manipulations

---

## 8. Smart Contracts and Implementation

### 8.1 Core Contracts
The Phoenix Protocol consists of four main smart contracts:

1. **PhoenixProtocol**: The main contract that serves as the entry point for the protocol. It handles user intents, transaction execution, and recovery processes.

2. **IntentRegistry**: Stores and manages user intents for transactions. Intents represent a user's desire to perform a specific action, which can be executed later by the protocol.

3. **RecoveryModule**: Manages the recovery process for transactions, allowing users to request recovery of funds and administrators to approve or reject these requests.

4. **TokenVault**: Serves as a secure vault for storing tokens used in the protocol. It handles deposits, withdrawals, and transfers of both native and ERC20 tokens.
